In a nutshell, a SLL is a data struction that contains a head, tail and a length property.  SLL consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.  Think of a set of train box-cars. 

SLL are fast for inserting and deleting data. This is because they don't have to re-index anything.  But because they don't have indexes, they don't offer random access.
